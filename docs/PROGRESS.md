## Decisions Log

### 2025-10-15: Project Initialization
- **Decision:** Use `modernc.org/sqlite` instead of `mattn/go-sqlite3`
- **Reason:** Pure Go implementation, no CGo required, easier cross-platform builds
- **Impact:** Simpler build process, better portability

### 2025-10-15: Directory Structure
- **Decision:** Use `internal/` for all application code
- **Reason:** Prevents external packages from importing our code
- **Impact:** Clear separation of public API (none) vs internal implementation

### 2025-10-15: Phase 1 Complete
- **Milestone:** Basic prototype working!
- **Achievement:** Full end-to-end flow from TUI ‚Üí SQLite ‚Üí success message
- **Binary size:** 9.5MB (includes all dependencies)
- **Status:** Ready for manual testing by user in real terminal

### 2025-10-15: Phase 2 Complete
- **Milestone:** Smart features implemented!
- **Achievement:** Entry parsing, markdown generation, intention/win prompts all working
- **Files Created:**
  - `internal/parser/parser.go` - Regex-based tag and momentum parsing
  - `internal/markdown/writer.go` - Markdown file generation with proper formatting
  - `internal/tui/intention.go` - Morning intention prompt screen
  - `internal/tui/win.go` - 10-entry win prompt screen
  - `README.md` - Comprehensive user documentation
- **Integration:** All features wired into `cmd/log/main.go` with proper flow control
- **Deferred:** Sign-off ritual and anchor suggestions moved to Phase 3
- **Status:** Ready for end-to-end testing with real logging workflow

### 2025-10-15: Phase 3 Complete
- **Milestone:** Viewing, stats, and sign-off complete!
- **Achievement:** Full daily ritual implemented from intention to confetti
- **Features Delivered:**
  - Command routing system for subcommands (view, stats)
  - `log view` - Beautiful display of today's entries
  - `log stats` - Weekly statistics with ASCII bar charts
  - Complete sign-off flow with 3 reflection questions
  - Confetti animation on day completion
  - Complete daylog markdown generation with reflections
- **Files Created:**
  - `internal/tui/view.go` - Entry viewing screen
  - `internal/tui/signoff.go` - Reflection questions screen
  - `internal/tui/confetti.go` - Animated celebration
  - `internal/analytics/stats.go` - Statistics formatting
- **Database Integration:** CompleteDaySignoff already existed, seamlessly integrated
- **Binary Size:** 9.6MB (unchanged from Phase 2)
- **Status:** Core daily ritual complete! Ready for real-world testing

### 2025-10-15: Roadmap Restructure (Phases 4-10)
- **Decision:** Reorganized remaining development into 7 comprehensive phases
- **Reason:** System spec contains many features not yet covered in original plan
- **Initial Phase Breakdown:**
  - Phase 4: Historical Viewing & Navigation (yesterday, week commands)
  - Phase 5: Intelligence & Awareness (anchors, redirects, energy patterns, honesty pact, time bookends)
  - Phase 6: Advanced Analytics (flag grouping, tag correlation, insights)
  - Phase 7: Extended Commands (search, export, streaks, insights, edge cases)
  - Phase 8: Customization & Configuration (config file, custom tags, themes, glamour)
  - Phase 9: Polish & Distribution (error handling, installation, homebrew, CI/CD)
- **Impact:** Clear roadmap covering all system spec features with ~70+ specific tasks
- **Note:** Later reorganized - see "Phase 4 Split & Enhanced" decision below

### 2025-10-15: Phase 4 Split & Enhanced with Utilities
- **Decision:** Split original Phase 4 into two phases and added essential utility commands
- **New Phase Structure:**
  - **Phase 4: Essential Utilities & Commands** - Daily-use utilities (help, edit, win, delete, thought)
  - **Phase 5: Historical Viewing & Navigation** - Past log viewing (yesterday, week, date navigation)
  - Shifted all subsequent phases down by one number (old Phase 5 ‚Üí Phase 6, etc.)
- **Added Features:**
  - Arrow momentum input solution: `+` `-` `=` `<` shortcuts for ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí ‚Üê
  - **NEW:** Back arrow ‚Üê momentum marker for waste/destructive actions
  - `log help` - Comprehensive help system with all tags, flags, and examples
  - `log edit` / `log edit <number>` - Edit recent or specific entries
  - `log win` - Quick win logging without waiting for 10-entry prompt
  - `log delete` / `log delete <number>` - Delete recent or specific entries
  - `log thought` - Quick lightweight thought logging without metadata
  - Stats improvement - Remove @signoff from tag distribution
- **Reason:**
  - Arrow input was critical missing feature (no way to type ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí without mapping arrow keys)
  - Edit/win/delete are high-frequency daily utilities needed before historical viewing
  - Back arrow ‚Üê adds important awareness dimension for destructive behaviors
- **Impact:**
  - Phase 4 now has 8 major feature groups focused on daily workflow
  - Clearer separation between immediate utilities (Phase 4) and historical analysis (Phase 5)
  - Total phases increased from 9 to 10
- **Status:** Phase 4 ready for implementation with comprehensive utility suite
