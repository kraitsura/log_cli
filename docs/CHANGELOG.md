- Shows friendly message: "‚ú® Welcome to after-hours! Happy logging :)"
- Skips intention and win prompts (already captured during main day)

- `internal/markdown/writer.go` - Added after-hours section splitting and appending

#### Example Output
```markdown
---
**Reflection:**
- Pulled off track: Email
- Kept on track: Focus
- Tomorrow protect: Morning deep work

---
**After-Hours:**
- 8:30pm | Quick bug fix ‚Üë @deep
- 9:15pm | Urgent email ‚Üí @admin
```

### After-Hours Visual Display in `log view`
**Completed:** 2025-10-15

#### Features

**1. Real-time Momentum Conversion:**
- Shortcuts (`++`, `--`, `==`, `<<`, `->`, `<-`) instantly convert to arrows as user types
- No need to wait until submit - transformations happen immediately
- Cursor position handled correctly during conversion

**2. Autocomplete Dropdown for Tags:**
- Type `@` to show context tag suggestions (@deep, @social, @admin, @break, @zone, @signoff)
- Type `[` to show flag tag suggestions ([LEAK], [FLOW], [STUCK], [GOLD], [DRIFT], [ANCHOR])
- Filters suggestions in real-time as user continues typing (e.g., `@d` shows only `@deep`)
- Navigate with ‚Üë‚Üì arrow keys, select with Tab or Enter
- Sleek dropdown styled with lipgloss borders and highlighting
- Auto-dismisses when cursor moves away or Esc is pressed

**3. Enhanced Help Text:**

## Key Decisions Log

### 2025-10-16: Phase 5 Complete - Historical Viewing & Navigation
- **Decision:** Implemented markdown parser as fallback for missing database data
- **Reason:** Enables recovery from database corruption, markdown files serve as backup
- **Impact:** Robust data recovery system, users never lose historical logs

### 2025-10-15: Real-Time Text Transformations & Autocomplete
- **Decision:** Added live momentum conversion and tag autocomplete
- **Reason:** Reduces friction, improves discoverability of tags, better UX
- **Impact:** Users can type naturally and see instant feedback, Tab key for autocomplete selection

### 2025-10-15: After-Hours Visual Display
- **Decision:** Use double-line separator (`‚ïê`) for after-hours section vs single line (`‚îÄ`) for reflections
- **Reason:** Clear visual hierarchy distinguishes special sections
- **Impact:** Better readability, users can quickly identify after-hours entries

### 2025-10-15: After-Hours Logging Feature
- **Decision:** Allow logging after sign-off in separate section
- **Reason:** Real life isn't perfect, users may need to log work done after official sign-off
- **Impact:** More flexible workflow, no data loss, maintains day integrity

### 2025-10-15: Phase 4 Split & Enhanced with Utilities
- **Decision:** Split original Phase 4 into two phases and added essential utility commands
- **New Phase Structure:**
  - **Phase 4: Essential Utilities & Commands** - Daily-use utilities (help, edit, win, delete, thought)
  - **Phase 5: Historical Viewing & Navigation** - Past log viewing (yesterday, week, date navigation)
- **Added Features:**
  - Arrow momentum input solution: `++` `--` `==` `<<` shortcuts for ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí ‚Üê
  - **NEW:** Back arrow ‚Üê momentum marker for waste/destructive actions
  - Complete suite of editing, deletion, and quick-entry commands
- **Reason:**
  - Arrow input was critical missing feature (no way to type arrows without keyboard mapping)
  - Edit/win/delete are high-frequency daily utilities needed before historical viewing
  - Back arrow ‚Üê adds important awareness dimension for destructive behaviors
- **Impact:**
  - Phase 4 now has 8 major feature groups focused on daily workflow
  - Clearer separation between immediate utilities (Phase 4) and historical analysis (Phase 5)
  - Total phases increased from 9 to 10

### 2025-10-15: Roadmap Restructure (Phases 4-10)
- **Decision:** Reorganized remaining development into 7 comprehensive phases
- **Reason:** System spec contains many features not yet covered in original plan
- **Impact:** Clear roadmap covering all system spec features with ~70+ specific tasks

### 2025-10-15: Phase 3 Complete
- **Milestone:** Viewing, stats, and sign-off complete!
- **Achievement:** Full daily ritual implemented from intention to confetti
- **Database Integration:** CompleteDaySignoff already existed, seamlessly integrated
- **Binary Size:** 9.6MB (unchanged from Phase 2)

### 2025-10-15: Phase 2 Complete
- **Milestone:** Smart features implemented!
- **Achievement:** Entry parsing, markdown generation, intention/win prompts all working
- **Integration:** All features wired into `cmd/log/main.go` with proper flow control
- **Deferred:** Sign-off ritual and anchor suggestions moved to Phase 3

### 2025-10-15: Phase 1 Complete
- **Milestone:** Basic prototype working!
- **Achievement:** Full end-to-end flow from TUI ‚Üí SQLite ‚Üí success message
- **Binary size:** 9.5MB (includes all dependencies)

### 2025-10-15: Directory Structure
- **Decision:** Use `internal/` for all application code
- **Reason:** Prevents external packages from importing our code
- **Impact:** Clear separation of public API (none) vs internal implementation

### 2025-10-15: Project Initialization
- **Decision:** Use `modernc.org/sqlite` instead of `mattn/go-sqlite3`
- **Reason:** Pure Go implementation, no CGo required, easier cross-platform builds
- **Impact:** Simpler build process, better portability
